        <h3>About The Creator</H3>
        <p>Hey, my name is Blake Bailey and I love disc golf. With me being a college student, having a job, and volunteering in my community, I don't go as often as I would like. But that just makes the times I do get to go very special. Disc golf is a getaway for me; it allows me to escape reality for a little while and just go enjoy the outdoor for a bit. For me, disc golf is something that everyone should give a try.</p>
